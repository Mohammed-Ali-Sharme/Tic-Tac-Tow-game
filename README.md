# Tic-Tac-Tow-game
A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is a basic implementation of the classic 3x3 grid game where two players take turns marking 'X' and 'O' on the grid. The first player to align three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins!
Technologies Used
HTML5: For creating the structure and layout of the game board.
CSS3: For styling the game board, buttons, and overall layout.
JavaScript: For implementing the game logic (handling turns, win conditions, resetting the game).
